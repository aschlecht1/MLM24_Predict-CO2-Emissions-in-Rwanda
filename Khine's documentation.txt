There are 497 unique locations marked by unique lat-long pairs. 
From the indices, we see there are 159 observations per unique location. This is because there are 53 weeks recorded per year (week 0-52) from 2019-2021. 53 weeksx3years = 159 observations per location.

The test set only has 49 weeks per location in 2022, because we are predicting through November only. 

Our end goal then is to predict emissions for 49 weeks out per location.
